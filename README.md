# Password-Strength-Checker

Password Strength Checker is a simple jquery plugin for measuring the strength of a password. Not only it measures the strength of the password, but also it will compare the password with 10000 common passwords and if the user's password is a common password it will inform the user. The plugin is also capable of creating strong passwords if the user needs one.
 

 Usage

 you can initialize the monitoring using monitorPassword();

 eg: $("#txtPassword").monitorPassword();


 To deactivate monitoring pass "destroy" as argument

 eg: $("#txtPassword").monitorPassword("destroy");
